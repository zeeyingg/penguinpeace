Activity 1:
1. Team, Game, Card classes
2. currentCard, currentTeam
3. runGame(), updateScore(), switchTeam()
4. All three
5.  1. Ask how many teams you are going to have in the game
    2. Create all the celebrity cards from a provided list 
    3. Shuffle the cards, pick a card for the currentTeam to guess
    4. Start the timer, and let the team play
    5. If the team guesses correctly, add a point to their counter. 
    6. If they pass, remove a point. Keep going until the timer runs out or there are no cards left.
    7. Switch the team, and repeat until there are no more cards.
6. Computers 
 display information
 computation
 be a general assistant
 hardware to work: you need to know what sort of hardware it has, so yes, you need objects to represent the hardware
7. "Yes, it's a wonderful idea" 

Activity 2:
1. The constructor initializes the instance variables
2. The heading describes the permission and the instance name
3. name and clue
4. getClue(), getName()
7. celebrity class has one constructor, but if we wanted to we could implement either 
   Celebrity(String name) for when we only want the name to be initialized or Celebrity() 
   for a default character or Celebrity(String clue) for when we are quirky

Activity 3:
1. JFrame - the background of the window - allows you to change its size and border and menu bar  
2. private ArrayList<Celebrity> celebGameList;
3. no, because you need to show the celebrity in the GUI
12. CelebrityGame()
13. Knows about the Celebrity object

Activity 4
17. Using the parameter @Overriden 
18. Using accessor methods. 
19. extends 
20. Gryphon()

DISCO:
* GUI is incredibly annoying to work and deal with
* Inheritance can be really useful in streamlining information between classes
* It's good practice to use super() when writing overloaded constructors 

QCC:
* What is SWING? 
* Uhmm, so why doesn't CelebrityRunner run a GUI?
* Did anyone actually get the game to display?
