L07 - But These Go Up To Eleven
2022-03-19
time spent: 3 humorous hours

DISCO:
- We learned how to play elevens
- It took a LOT longer to complete this lab than expected
- Most of the time was spent reading as opposed to programming
- Javadocs is pretty nifty
- There are different ways to shuffle a deck
- Fred + George = FEORGE

QCC:
- HOW DO THE GRAPHICS WORK?
- WHERE IS ACTIVITY 6?
- WHERE IS ACTIVITY 5 BYTE FILE?
- Why do we care about the royals in variations of elevens? They're literally useless and take up space.
