### What encourages me?
- My mother wanting to adopt TAQS and to throw me to the curb.

### Our Experience
- This lab was pretty easy to understand and get the hang of. Learning how to run the class path command was unfunny and required a learning curve. Overall, it's one of the more useful labs I've done and I'm satisfied with how we were able to learn to extract data.
