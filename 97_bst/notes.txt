HW97 -- Prune Your Tree
2022-05-11f
time spent: 1 hrs
 
DISCO:
* Always look for the smallest value on the rightside to use as a replacement for
* Getting rid of nodes with one child is easy! Two children is a different story

QCC:
* How do you use piggybacking in order to come up with a working remove()? 
* Is it possible to make remove() recursive?

ALGO:
* Recurse through the tree until you reached the node that should be removed
* If the node has no or one children, then replace the node's current value with its left or right value
* If the node has two children, find the smallest value on the right branch and replace the node
