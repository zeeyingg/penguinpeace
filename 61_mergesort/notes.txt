HW60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle
2022-02-07
time spent: 0.5

DISCO:
- Minimal work as possible for each termite/turtle/thinker
- Merge sort is a much easier sort than the others we have learned so far

QCC:
- What additional parts of the firmware are we missing that sorts the deck?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
0. Be given a deck
1. Divide deck with >1 card into two decks
2. Hand one deck to one empty-handed thinker, the other deck to a different empty-handed thinker 
3. Compare each card in the deck you're given with your current deck
4. Once you receive one card, return that card to the thinker who gave it to you.
