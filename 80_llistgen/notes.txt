DISCO:
* Whenever you want to change return type, you should start with the interface.
* Cmd/Ctrl + F is your friend -- Cmd/Ctrl + F and Replace All is NOT.
* When you are initializing your return type, that gets mapped over to the placeholder.
* The placeholder can be anything, except a keyword or an imported type.

QCC:
* Why doesn't Java throw a symbol not found error when you are using a placeholder?
* On a similar note, why don't you have to initialize the placeholder "T"?
