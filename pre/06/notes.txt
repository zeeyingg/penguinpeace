Chapter 07
- while statement
- for loop; more efficient than while loop (initalizer, coniditon, and the update)
- encapuslation and generalization: 
	1. write a few lines of code and test them in main
	2. when they are working, wrap them in a new method and test them again (encapsulation)
	3. replace literal values with variables and paramters (generalization)
- do while statement (don't really understand this)
- break exits the loop
- continue moves to the next iteration
