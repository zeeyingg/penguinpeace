HW82 -- Roll Your Own Iterator
2022-03-28m
time spent : 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
* Iterator functionality can override FOREACH loop -- reminds me of toString.
* When we return the MyIterator() in the iterator(), we had to set aside memory.
* When using next() and remove(), we had to throw NoSuchElementException and IllegalStateException.

QCC:
* Previously when we've used the FOREACH loop, have we always been using the
functionality of Iterator?
* What are other examples of Iterables besides Collections?
* Can Iterator be implemented to traverse both directions of a linked list?
* Why not use a try-catch block?
* How does the driver (V6Driver) test remove()?
