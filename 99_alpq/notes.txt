 DISCO:
* PriorityQueue is a lot simpler to implement if you don't have to worry about different comparable types
* ArrayList methods work very nicely to make an ordered list

QCC:
* Will making ArrayPriorityQueue type-neutral involve simply changing the type of cargo to a generic comparable type?
* Could you call this Queue a subclass of ArrayList (and is it possible to implement it as such)?
