 DISCO:
 * Sleep is incredibly, incredibly important.
 * The heap invariant is that the left subtree is never greater than the root
and vice versa for the right subtree
  * Building a binary heap is similar to maintaining the invariant of the
  array priority queue

 QCC:
 * What should each swap be contingent on? The node or the node's values?
