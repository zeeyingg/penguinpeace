DISCO:
- Z needs to be changed to Comparable.
- We do not need to keep track of size() as ArrayList and LinkedList do that for us already.
- We can use the various methods built in the different types of Collections to implement stacks more easily.

QCC
- Why does Z need to be changed to Comparable?
- What other methods will we be implementing for stacks?
