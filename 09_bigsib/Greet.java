/*

DISCOVERIES:
- cocatenate strings using "+" operand
- java class names are case-senstive and must align with the file name in order to be compiled and run
- cannot print a string twice in two different fxn calls (i.e. System.out.println in main and System.out.println in greet)
- replacing void with String changes the method to only output a string, the output identifier  doesn't have to align with the parameter type
- you make block comments using /* message * / 

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS:
I know there is a shorter, more efficient way of cocatenating strings using f-strings. How would we implement that in here?
