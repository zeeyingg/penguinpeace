DISCO:
- offer() - inserts the element in the first position unless it violates capacity restrictions
- poll() - retrives and removes the first element at the first position; returns null if deck is empty
- these two methods basically do the same thing as add() and remove(), just with more safety checks
- addLast() == add()

QCC:
- Why can't LL be converted to QQKachoo? We keep getting this error even though we 
initialized the LL the same way in our previous homework.
- How do we throw other exceptions?
