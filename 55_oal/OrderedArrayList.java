 DISCO:
- Note that worst case vs. best case is not the same as changing the size. How good or bad a case is cannot depend solely on the
  size of that case; it must refer to variation within different cases of the same size.
- With indexed collections, it is typical to have a constant execution time of O(1) because you can easily jump to an index directly.

  QCC:
- (Just to confirm) In the defintion of big-O notation, the constant M for which f(x)<= Mg(x) cannot be negative? Are there
situations in which this actually comes up?
- (completely random but) how do dictionaries work, in terms of memory structure?


*/

/*
Execution time is O(n) because as the size of the arraylist increases, the execution time of the constructor increases linearly

Since there is no difference in how this method proceeds depending on the order of the contents of the array
or anything else besides size, there is no best or worst case.

  Best Case: O(1). The best case would be adding a value which is equal to the current array's middle value or the average of the two middle values rounded down.
  Execution time will therefore be constant across all array sizes.

  Worst Case: O(log n). One of several possible worst cases would be the two extreme values, which require the maximum number of
  comparisons and reassignments of lo, med, and hi. In this case, for every time that size increases by a factor of 2,
  execution time increases by k. Thus, execution time should be proportional to log_2 of size, so the function is O(log n)
