Activity 1:
1)
    a. sentimentVal( String )
    b. This method required a String parameter. If a different parameter
       is given, a compile time error will occur.
    c. This method returns a double.

2)
    System.out.println(sentimentVal("backward"));
    System.out.println(sentimentVal("terrible"));
    System.out.println(sentimentVal("wonderful"));

3) a. Statement would compile because the return type of the method correlates
      with the return type of the variable.

  b. Statement would not compile because the return type, double, does not
    correlate with String, the return type of the variable.

  c. Statement would not compile because there are two parameters in the method
    call, not one. Therfore, the method wont be correctly called.

4) totalSentiment takes the input of the new file, and so as long as there is
  input, sentimentVal is run on each word. The results are stored in value, and
  a try-catch loops ensures that FileNotFoundExceptions will be caught. The value
  is returned at the end of the loop.

5) a. Yes, the rating makes sense. For every 5 point increase, the star rating is
  increased.

  b. To adjust the totalSentiment method, we could count the number of
    words there are and scale the required rating by the number of
    words. That way, we can accurately adjust the starRating so that the method
    accounts for the length of the review and scales stars accordingly. Large
    reviews won't be given 5 stars, but will be evaluated with their size in
    context.

6)

  The order of the student's code prevents a range from being specified.
  The student incorrectly assumed that all if-statements would be checked
    at once. Instead, because if-statements are evaluated in descending order,
    the code will check if totalSentiment is less than 15 first. That would cause
    ratings all less than 15 to be given a 4, even if they're less than 10, 5, or 0.
    This prevents the later statements from evaluating anything. To fix this,
    the student would simply flip the order of the conditions and return statements.
